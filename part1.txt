Chapter 1 : The story of Amir

Amir sat on the cold floor of his dimly lit apartment,
 a single candle flickering on the windowsill. 
 He stared at his trembling hands, calloused and
  raw from the hours he’d spent assembling products at a
   local factory. The job paid poorly, and the relentless 
   noise of the machines gnawed at his thoughts even in the 
   silence of the night.

It had been a year since his mother passed away, 
leaving him alone in a city that felt indifferent
 to his struggles. Every day seemed like a battle 
 he couldn’t win—a never-ending cycle of exhaustion 
 and despair.
